# Landing Page Project
A mockup of a landing page design provided by The Odin Project.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to utilize all the skills I've learned from The Odin Project so far, particularly, HTML and CSS.

## Features
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Reusuable container class for layout purposes

## Live Demo
https://brodr2932.github.io/odin-landing-page/

## Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Lessons Learned
- I learned about other CSS properties that I have not encountered yet from The Odin Project (border-radius, position, cursor).
- I learned how to better organize my CSS styles to align with the structure of my HTML.
- I learned how to use container divs to adjust the width of content without affecting their background color.
